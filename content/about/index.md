#### Professional

I am a cloud architect and engineer with experience across several diverse organizations. I currently manage the platform engineering team at Balyasny Asset Management in Chicago where I lead the organization’s cloud computing related strategy and implementation. Previous to Balyasny, I’ve been a part of organizations such as: McDonald’s Corporation, US Foods, and PwC’s Digital Technology and Cloud consulting practice. I am an AWS certified architect and developer. I am also an AWS Certification Subject Matter Expert (SME), where I assist with the development and enhancement of AWS certification exams. I am an AWS Community Builder.

I have experience across a wide range of technical and cloud platforms and have played key roles in the adoption of AWS’ IaaS and PaaS offerings within multiple organizations. I’ve created and implemented standards around infrastructure as code and automation using CloudFormation, Terraform, and Chef. I have knowledge of both Python and Golang and have used them both heavily while automating tasks related to AWS.

In addition to technical skills, I am also experienced in working directly with business stakeholders and conveying complex technical concepts into simpler terms. During my time at both US Foods, as well as PwC, I have presented to executive teams on both the technical and organizational changes required to successfully adopt DevOps practices. I love to learn new concepts, and can do so quickly. I am not afraid to push the status-quo in order to see an organization reach new levels with technology.

#### Personal

I grew up in Oswego, Illinois, where I went through the Oswego public school system for grades K-12. During my time in the Oswego schools, I became involved in many activities, including: band, drum major of the marching band for 2 years, marched in the 2005 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, National Honor Society, and more. I also became involved in the school district’s technology department during my 4 years of high school, where I slowly got more and more involved in the district’s technology initiatives.

I attended North Central College in Naperville, Illinois from 2008-2012 where I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Management Information Systems. I also minored in Computer Science and Economics during my time there. During my four years at NCC, I was involved in the band, took private trumpet lessons, and was a featured Management Information Systems student as a junior and senior. During college, I continued working for the Oswego schools as a member of the technology department.

#### Hobbies & Life

I live in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood, where I enjoy being a part of city life.

Outside of work, I’m very into photography and technology. I enjoy learning about new kinds of technology, whether that be through reading articles about it or getting my hands on something new. I also am a very avid reader and have a never ending list of books to read. I’m a huge coffee fanatic!
