Tomorrow is my 25th birthday! As a child, it's always hard to imagine living to be a quarter century old, but here we are. And, hey, now I can rent a car without paying extra for my age!

As I reflect on the last year of my life, I realize I've done so many things! I am 100% certain I've missed a lot of crucial items in this list, but I am hoping this gives a good summary.

## Here's to 25!

This year, I hope to focus more on myself and my well being, while also being a more well-rounded individual. Some goals for the year:

* Apply for grad school
* Excel in my career
* Get my PMP
* Read a book every month
* Less time wasting activities - more productivity
* Use that new bike! And get into a routine of exercise
* Really, for real, eat better food and eat less of it
